# Create PR Description

Generate a pull request title and description following the project's PR style.

## Instructions

1. Run `git log main..HEAD --oneline --stat` (or the appropriate base branch) to understand all commits and files changed.
2. Write a `pr.md` file at the repository root with the following structure:

### Structure

```markdown
# <Title>

## Summary

- **<Feature/change area>** — One-sentence description of what was added or changed and why it matters.
- ... (one bullet per logical change area, not per commit)
```

### Style Rules

- **Title**: Use imperative mood, start with a verb (Add, Fix, Refactor, etc.). Summarize the entire PR scope — not just one commit.
- **Summary bullets**: Each bullet is `**Bold label** — description`. Group related commits into a single bullet when they touch the same feature area.
- **Tone**: Concise, technical, no filler. State what changed and the user-facing or architectural impact.
- **No test plan section**: Do not include a "Test plan" or "Testing" section.
- **No emoji**.
- **No "Generated by" footer**.
